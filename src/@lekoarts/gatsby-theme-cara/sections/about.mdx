> The elaboration of a systematic theory of liberty has been rare enough, but exposition of a _theory of strategy_ for liberty has been virtually nonexistent. Indeed, not only for liberty, strategy toward reaching any sort of desired social goal has been generally held to be catch-as-catch-can, a matter of hit-or-miss experimentation, of trial and error. Yet, if philosophy can set down any theoretical guidelines for a strategy for liberty it is certainly its responsibility to search for them.

â€” Murray N. Rothbard, _The Ethics of Liberty_

And it is to that end that I engage in this education of liberty. Our ideology is the most consistent and beautiful of them all, yet it is laughed out of the room. My belief is that elaboration on every facet of our belief in a manner that may be understood by all will help to rectify this, thereby freeing more minds to our cause.
