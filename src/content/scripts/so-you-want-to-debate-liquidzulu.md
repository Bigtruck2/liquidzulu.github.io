# How to Get in Touch

So, you want to debate me? Cool, I am open to debate anybody who has an issue with one of my positions. You can get in touch with me through Discord, my username is `liquidzulu`, and this is my preferred means of communication. Alternatively you can contact me on twitter (`@liquid2ulu`), or through email, `liquidzulu [at] pm.me`.

# What I Will NOT Debate

I am basically sick of the following topics and will be unlikely to accept a debate on them:

-   [group property](http://liquidzulu.github.io/homesteading-and-property-rights#on-the-impossibility-of-group-ownership)&#x2014;my argument on this front has been done to death, and I have essentially zero confidence that you will bring anything new to the table;
-   [argumentation ethics](https://liquidzulu.github.io/the-nap/#the-argument-from-argument)&#x2014;again, I have said basically everything that there is to be said on this topic in innumerable debates, and I find it completely boring. Try something broader like "the non-aggression principle" or "anarcho-capitalism."

# Please, for the love of reason, understand your timezone (I'm talking to you "EST" people)

For some reason, I do not know why, people who are in the eastern United States are allergic to understanding what their timezone actually is. Almost every individual I have encountered from this region has said that they want to talk to me at some time EST. EST is Eastern _Standard_ Time&#x2014;this timezone is only active year round in **_VERY FEW_** locations. You are probably not in Eastern _Standard_ Time year-round. You are probably in Eastern Time (ET)&#x2014;this automatically shifts to Eastern _Daylight_ Time (EDT) during the summer months. Consult [timeanddate](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html) for your timezone (it will warn you if you try to select EST during the summer, because you probably are not in EST).
