# The Homesteading Principle

Now that the non-aggression principle has been demonstrated as an apodictically correct axiom of law some initial implications can be derived, the first of which is the homesteading principle, which can be stated as: ownership is assigned to the initial possessor of any external good, where *homesteading* is defined as initial possession. You will often see this described as the prior-later distinction, that is, the homesteading principle gives precedence to the first comer over any latecomers.

Consider Crusoe and Friday, stranded on a desert island. Crusoe comes across a stick in nature and homesteads it&#x2013;i.e. takes initial possession of it&#x2013;then he fashions it into a spear which he plans to use for spearfishing. On his way to the ocean, however, Friday sees this stick and thinks that it would be a useful tool to stoke his fire, and so he attempts to re-possess it&#x2013;that is take it&#x2013;from Crusoe. We have a conflict, Crusoe can&rsquo;t spearfish at the same time that Friday stokes his fire, and it is intuatively clear that Friday has initiated this conflict.

First, it must be noted that ownership is necessarily distinct from possession, and this is pre-supposed as true by both Crusoe and Friday&#x2014;in asserting different ownership claims they are saying that they have the *just* possession, i.e. if someone else has possession, that is *unjust* possession. We know this, because *ownership* itself is defined as just possession. Kinsella points out<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup> that the fact that ownership and possession are distinct implies that only first possession is justifiable. If $B$ can become the owner of a thing by merely taking it from $A$, that means that $C$ could take it from $B$ and thereby become the owner&#x2014;but this would mean that possession and ownership are not distinct; whomever is able to possess the stick would be the owner, and this contradicts the presumption by all parties that ownership and possession *are* distinct. Therefore, as it is a contradiction to propose that the latecomer has a property right, we are left with the initial possessor having the only justifiable claim to the property right&#x2014;initial possession is the only just possession, and therefore it is only the homesteader who has the unique status of ownership.

> In other words, we can see not only that Lockean homesteading […] is inextricably bound up with the prior-later distinction […] ***but that the very idea of ownership implies that only libertarian-style ownership is justifiable***.<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3" role="doc-backlink">3</a></sup>

But what about the Georgist anti-homestead ethic, which would claim that the first possessor *also* doesn’t have the ownership right, and in fact that homesteading itself is a crime against everyone else? This ethic fails on the grounds of its very proposal, to engage in argumentation one must first homestead *something*, at the very least their standing room. Before beginning any ethical deliberation you therefore must accept it to be just&#x2013;that is to say argumentatively justifiable&#x2013;to take initial possession of scarce physical means.

Hoppe explains that a latecomer ethic implies the death of humanity:<sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4" role="doc-backlink">4</a></sup>

> What is wrong with this idea of dropping the prior-later distinction as morally irrelevant? First, if the late-comers, i.e., those who did not in fact do something with some scarce goods, had indeed as much of a right to them as the first-comers, i.e., those who did do something with the scarce goods, then literally no one would be allowed to do anything with anything, as one would have to have all of the late-comers’ consent prior to doing whatever one wanted to do. Indeed, as posterity would include one’s children’s children—people, that is, who come so late that one could never possibly ask them—advocating a legal system that does not make use of the prior-later distinction as part of its underlying property theory is simply absurd in that it implies advocating death but must presuppose life to advocate any thing. Neither we, our forefathers, nor our progeny could, do, or will survive and say or argue anything if one were to follow this rule. In order for any person—past, present, or future—to argue anything it must be possible to survive now. Nobody can wait and suspend acting until everyone of an indeterminate class of late-comers happens to appear and agree to what one wants to do. Rather, insofar as a person finds himself alone, he must be able to act, to use, produce, consume goods straightaway, prior to any agreement with people who are simply not around yet (and perhaps never will be). And insofar as a person finds himself in the company of others and there is conflict over how to use a given scarce resource, he must be able to resolve the problem at a definite point in time with a definite number of people instead of having to wait unspecified periods of time for unspecified numbers of people. Simply in order to survive, then, which is a prerequisite to arguing in favor of or against anything, property rights cannot be conceived of as being timeless and nonspecific regarding the number of people concerned. Rather, they must necessarily be thought of as originating through acting at definite points in time for definite acting individuals.
> 
> Furthermore, the idea of abandoning the prior-later distinction, which socialism finds so attractive, would again simply be incompatible with the nonaggression principle as the practical foundation of argumentation. To argue and possibly agree with someone (if only on the fact that there is dis agreement) means to recognize each other’s prior right of exclusive control over his own body. Otherwise, it would be impossible for anyone to first say anything at a definite point in time and for someone else to then be able to reply, or vice versa, as neither the first nor the second speaker would be independent physical decision-making units anymore, at any time. Eliminating the prior-later distinction then, as socialism attempts to do, is tantamount to eliminating the possibility of arguing and reaching agreement. However, as one cannot argue that there is no possibility for discussion without the prior control of every person over his own body being recognized and accepted as fair, a late-comer ethic that does not wish to make this difference could never be agreed upon by anyone. Simply saying that it could implies a contradiction, as one’s being able to say so would presuppose one’s existence as an independent decision-making unit at a definite point in time.


# Self-Ownership

Above the homestead principle was defined as &ldquo;ownership is assigned to the initial possessor of any *external* good.&rdquo; This is important because the above analysis only works for goods which are external to the body of an acting man, it assumes that there are already acting men going into nature and extracting various goods from it. A persons body is an entirely different type of object, there aren’t bodies out in nature waiting for some &ldquo;soul&rdquo; to come along and homestead them. Rather a body is necessarily linked to an actor. It is this objective link which imbues a man with ownership. Homesteading is merely one form of demonstrating this link, so how do we deal with the case of establishing links between acting men and the bodies used for action?

Recall that property rights in general are conflict avoiding norms, that is to say, the very nature of ownership is to avoid conflicts. Recall also that this was derived from the nature of argumentation itself, so we can go back to argumentation to derive an assignment of property rights in bodies; for $A$ and $B$ to argue with each other, they have to first assume that the other guy owns himself, imagine if $A$ tried to argue that $B$ is actually owned by $C$. Well, this would mean that $B$ would be a mere mouthpiece for $C$ and thus $A$ would actually be arguing with $C$ which contradicts the presumption that $A$ is arguing with $B$. Therefore, you could never propose that someone else is a slave without contradiction, in trying to demonstrate to this man that he is your or someone elses slave, you would have to first assume that he owns himself, then propose that you or someone else owns him&#x2014;i.e. that he does not own himself.

> Moreover, any outsider who claims another’s body cannot deny this objective link and its special status, since the outsider also necessarily presupposes this in his own case. This is so because in seeking dominion over the other, in asserting ownership over the other’s body, he has to presuppose his own ownership of his body, which demonstrates he does place a certain significance on this link, at the same time that he disregards the significance of the other’s link to his own body.<sup><a id="fnr.5" class="footref" href="#fn.5" role="doc-backlink">5</a></sup>

Furthermore, we consider that a slavery ethic&#x2013;i.e. an ethic which rejects self-ownership&#x2013;cannot make for a human ethic. To be an ethic for humanity, it must satisfy two properties; first, it must be universal, i.e. it must apply to all humans, and second, it must actually ensure the survival of mankind, or else it would be an anti-human ethic, and an anti-human ethic could not be proposed without contradiction as you must first presume that you should be alive and arguing. Rothbard has pointed out<sup><a id="fnr.6" class="footref" href="#fn.6" role="doc-backlink">6</a></sup> that if you do not have a system of total self-ownership, two possibilities remain:

1.  universal and equal other-ownership, which he calls the “communist” ethic, or;
2.  partial ownership of one group by another.

Universal co-ownership fails on the grounds that it would imply the near immediate death of humanity because for any person to survive they must act, and if everyone is co-owned by everyone then any given person must first ask everyone elses permission before engaging in some action, but asking permission is itself an action, therefore everyone must immediately start doing *nothing*. Further, it is not strictly possible to purposefully not act, we note that action is defined as purposeful behaviour, so even in ceasing physical motion a man is acting insofar as this ceasing is done *purposefully*. Therefore, this ethic simply cannot be obeyed no matter what a man chooses to do, as choosing any option implies action.

Partial ownership of one group by another doesn’t necessarily mean the death of humanity, but it is not universal&#x2014;instead of being an ethic for humans it is an ethic which implies a set of sub-humans ruled by humans. This is thus a particularistic ethic&#x2014;it&rsquo;s a norm of the form one rule for thee and another for me. But if the partial ownership ethic was truly rational it must be able to be derived from the nature of the entities that it applies to. Thus there would have to be some principled difference between the group of humans and the group of sub-humans. We know that legal ethics are derived from argumentation, and as such they would have to apply to all beings with the potential to argue. Therefore there could be no relevant difference between different groups of humans with respect to law, as all humans qua acting being have the potential to engage in argumentation. One could come up with any number of selection criteria to split mankind into different sets; perhaps one wants to split man into different races, or nations, or into northern and southern hemispheres, etc. The point of note is that these different groups do not have different logics&#x2014;so any conclusions derived that apply to arguing beings as such would have to apply to all of them.


# The Impossibility of Group Ownership

Now that we have a theory of property that accounts for both self-ownership and external ownership, we can begin to address some implications of this theory, the first of which is that ownership is necessarily individual&#x2014;that is, group ownership is strictly impossible. Consider a set of people, $\{A,\cdots,Z\}$, who each commonly own a stick. What is to be done about a conflict over the use of this stick between $A$ and $B$? There are two possibilities, either $A$ is said to be the just victor, or $B$ is. If $A$, then he owns the stick and $B$ does not, if $B$ then he owns the stick, and $A$ does not. But both options contradict the presumption that every member in the set owned the stick, therefore group ownership simply cannot occur.

Allow me to go over some supposed solutions to this conundrum, the first of which is the democratic one. Essentially have all members within the set vote to determine who the just victor is&#x2014;still, any who lost the vote did not own the stick, as their desired possession was considered unjust. Also consider the set which only consists of $A$ and $B$, what vote could possibly be conducted between these men which would not come out as $A$ in favour of $A$ and $B$ in favour of $B$? If $B$ voted for $A$ or vice versa there would be no conflict, and law studies only those set of situations where there is conflict rather than those where men are in harmonious agreement about how things should be done.

The next proposal for a solution comes from Roderick Long, he sates:<sup><a id="fnr.7" class="footref" href="#fn.7" role="doc-backlink">7</a></sup>

> On the libertarian view, we have a right to the fruit of our labor, and we also have a right to what people freely give us. Public property can arise in both these ways.
> 
> Consider a village near a lake. It is common for the villagers to walk down to the lake to go fishing. In the early days of the community it’s hard to get to the lake because of all the bushes and fallen branches in the way. But over time, the way is cleared and a path forms — not through any centrally coordinated effort, but simply as a result of all the individuals walking that way day after day.
> 
> The cleared path is the product of labor — not any individual’s labor, but all of them together. If one villager decided to take advantage of the now-created path by setting up a gate and charging tolls, he would be violating the collective property right that the villagers together have earned.
> 
> Public property can also be the product of gift. In 19th-century England, it was common for roads to be built privately and then donated to the public for free use. This was done not out of altruism but because the roadbuilders owned land and businesses alongside the site of the new road, and they knew that having a road there would increase the value of their land and attract more customers to their businesses. Thus, the unorganized public can legitimately come to own land, both through original acquisition (the mixing of labor) and through voluntary transfer.

So Long provides two cases that he sees as legitimate group property; (1) where a group communally “mix their labour” with an object in nature, and (2) where a man transfers ownership of his private property to a group in common. The issue with (1) is that Long relies on the faulty labour theory of property. It is not mixing labour with land which imbues a man with ownership, as we have seen it is the nature of scarcity giving rise to the potential for conflict which implies property rights. To demonstrate the failure of this theory more thorougly, allow me to quote Kinsella at length:<sup><a id="fnr.8" class="footref" href="#fn.8" role="doc-backlink">8</a></sup>

> As noted before, some libertarian IP advocates, such as Rand, hold that creation is the source of property rights. This confuses the nature and reasons for property rights, which lie in the undeniable fact of scarcity. Given scarcity and the correspondent possibility of conflict in the use of resources, conflicts are avoided and peace and cooperation are achieved by allocating property rights to such resources. And the purpose of property rights dictates the nature of such rules. For if the rules allocating property rights are to serve as objective rules that all can agree upon so as to avoid conflict, they cannot be biased or arbitrary. For this reason, unowned resources come to be owned—homesteaded or appropriated—by the first possessor.
> 
> The general rule, then, is that ownership of a given scarce resource can be identified by determining who first occupied it. There are various ways to possess or occupy resources, and different ways to demonstrate or prove such occupation, depending upon the nature of the resource and the use to which it is put. Thus, I can pluck an apple from the wild and thereby homestead it, or I can fence in a plot of land for a farm. It is sometimes said that one form of occupation is “forming” or “creating” the thing. For example, I can sculpt a statue from a block of marble, or forge a sword from raw metal, or even “create” a farm on a plot of land.
> 
> We can see from these examples that creation is relevant to the question of ownership of a given “created” scarce resource, such as a statue, sword, or farm, only to the extent that the act of creation is an act of occupation, or is otherwise evidence of first occupation. However, “creation” itself does not justify ownership in things; it is neither necessary nor sufficient. One cannot create some possibly disputed scarce resource without first using the raw materials used to create the item. But these raw materials are scarce, and either I own them or I do not. If not, then I do not own the resulting product. If I own the inputs, then, by virtue of such ownership, I own the resulting thing into which I transform them.
> 
> Consider the forging of a sword. If I own some raw metal (because I mined it from ground I owned), then I own the same metal after I have shaped it into a sword. I do not need to rely on the fact of creation to own the sword, but only on my ownership of the factors used to make the sword. And I do not need creation to come to own the factors, since I can homestead them by simply mining them from the ground and thereby becoming the first possessor. On the other hand, if I fashion a sword using your metal, I do not own the resulting sword. In fact, I may owe you damages for trespass or conversion.

Long’s second case, where a man transfers title to his property to some group, fails on the grounds that it does not resolve the contradiction, therefore making that contract invalid. Contract theory will be elucidated thorougly in a future lesson, so I will not explain this point too deeply here, just note that it will be seen that contract theory arises *from* property theory, and therefore you cannot have contracts which allow for contradictory property claims, Long is essentially putting the cart before the horse.

A further potential solution for group property rights is the polycentrist solution.<sup><a id="fnr.9" class="footref" href="#fn.9" role="doc-backlink">9</a></sup> To the polycentrist, law in a libertarian society is decided by reference to competing arbitrators, these judges could settle disputes and thus determine the arrangement of property. So for our above example of $\{A,\cdots,Z\}$ all collectively owning a stick, they would simply have to go to some judge to decide who has just possession. The problem with this is first that it is confused about the nature of law&#x2014;justice cannot be decreed by man, rather it depends on the normative structure of argumentation. And second, the contradiction is still not resolved, if this Judge rules in favour of $A$, $B$ did not own the stick and vice versa.


# The Blockean Proviso

There is a potential conundrum for this theory of homesteading which goes as follows:

![img](/donut-homestead.png "A diagram showing a section of land, A, enclosing a section of land, B, via its donut shape.")<sup><a id="fnr.10" class="footref" href="#fn.10" role="doc-backlink">10</a></sup>

There are three sections of land, $\mathbb{A}$, $\mathbb{B}$, and $\mathbb{C}$ as pictured. Crusoe comes along and homesteads $\mathbb{A}$. Friday currently resides somewhere in $\mathbb{C}$. Because Crusoe does not own $\mathbb{B}$, Friday does not have a duty to Crusoe to not enter it. And because Crusoe does own $\mathbb{A}$, Friday does have a duty to Crusoe to not enter $\mathbb{A}$. So, Friday is allowed to enter $\mathbb{B}$, but not $\mathbb{A}$. However, due to the donut shape of Crusoes homestead, to enter $\mathbb{B}$ implies entering $\mathbb{A}$, hence, a contradiction arises&#x2014;Friday both has a duty not to enter $\mathbb{B}$ and he does not have said duty. That is to say, Crusoe is acting like he is the owner $\mathbb{B}$ of when he is in fact not&#x2014;this is called forestalling. The proposed solution put forward by those in the Walter Block camp is the Blockean Proviso. Essentially, they claim that the contradiction arises from assuming that Crusoe has indeed homesteaded all of $\mathbb{A}$, therefore to resolve the contradiction these donut homesteads must be disallowed. This formulation, provided by Łukasz Dominiak, resolves a counterargument made by Kinsella,<sup><a id="fnr.11" class="footref" href="#fn.11" role="doc-backlink">11</a></sup> where he imagines that the donut is not owned by Crusoe himself, but by 100 Crusoes we could call Crusoe<sub>1</sub> through to Crusoe<sub>100</sub>, which of these individual segments does Friday have the right to cross over and why not any of the others? Surely if they each sequentially homesteaded their individual segments, none of them are individually forestalling. The solution to this is that it is Crusoe<sub>100</sub>, who seals up the donut who has committed a crime, as he was not able to homestead that final section.

However, there is a way to resolve this contradiction without any need for a proviso, as Kinsella writes in defense of embordering-as-homesteading, utilising de Jasay’s “let exclusion stand” principle:<sup><a id="fnr.12" class="footref" href="#fn.12" role="doc-backlink">12</a></sup>

> In a nutshell: de Jasay equates property with its owner’s “excluding” others from using it, for example by fencing in immovable property (e.g. land) or finding or creating (and keeping) movable property. Thus, the principle means “let ownership stand,” i.e., that claims to ownership of property appropriated from the state of nature or acquired ultimately through a chain of title tracing back to such an appropriation should be respected. De Jasay uses this idea to demolish the criticism that homesteading unowned resources unilaterally and unjustifiably imposes on others moral duties to refrain from interfering.

I.e. it is the very nature of property itself that the owner excludes others from using it, we can then say that Crusoe in excluding others from accessing this previously unowned territory $\mathbb{A}$, thereby becomes its owner. It is this act of exclusion which *is* Crusoe initially possessing both the donut and the donut-hole. Kinsella goes on:

> Note that the de Jasayan idea of “let exclusion stand” or the Hoppean idea that the prior-later distinction is of crucial importance also sheds light on the nature of homesteading itself. Often the question is asked as to what types of acts constitute or are sufficient for homesteading (or “embordering” as Hoppe sometimes refers to it); what type of “labor” must be “mixed with” a thing; and to what property does the homesteading extend? What “counts” as “sufficient” homesteading? Etc. And we can see that in a way the answer to these questions is related to the issue of what is the thing in dispute. In other words, if B claims ownership of a thing possessed (or formerly possessed) by A, then the very framing of the dispute helps to identify what the thing is and what counts as possession of it. If B claims ownership of a given resource, he must want the right to control it according to its nature. Then the question becomes, did someone else previously control it (according to its nature); i.e., did someone else already homestead it, so that B is only a latecomer? This ties in with de Jasay’s “let exclusion stand” principle, which rests on the idea that if someone is actually able to control a resource such that others are excluded, then this exclusion should “stand.” Of course, the physical nature of a given scarce resource and the way in which humans use such resources will determine the nature of actions needed to “control” it and exclude others.
> 
> De Jasay, as a matter of fact, considers two basic types of appropriation: “finding and keeping” and “enclosure.” The former applies primarily to movable objects that may be found, taken, and hidden or used exclusively. Since the thing has no other owner, prima facie no one is entitled to object to the first possessor claiming ownership.
> 
> For immovable property (land), possession is taken by “enclosing” the land and incurring exclusion costs, e.g., erecting a fence (again, similar to Hoppe’s “embordering”—establishing an objective, intersubjectively ascertainable border). As in the case with movables, others’ loss of the opportunity to appropriate the property does not give rise to a claim sufficient to oust the first possessor (if it did, it would be an ownership claim).

So in the case where Friday is in $\mathbb{C}$, Crusoe instantly becomes the owner of both $\mathbb{A}$ and $\mathbb{B}$ after he completes his embordering. In the case where Friday is in $\mathbb{B}$, assuming nobody else is in $\mathbb{C}$, Crusoe would become the immediate owner of both $\mathbb{A}$ and $\mathbb{C}$, but what of the case where there are people or homesteaded property in both $\mathbb{B}$ and $\mathbb{C}$? In that situation, it becomes clear that Crusoe would indeed be forestalling in fencing off $\mathbb{A}$, as he *could not* become the owner of the owned property on either side of his border. That is to say, this type of fencing off, would be claiming possession of not unowned land, but of the owned property of others.

With an objective standard for homesteading elucidated and re-enforced against all previously formulated attacks, the next lesson will be an elaboration of contract theory.
