> If ethics is a normative discipline that identifies and classifies certain sets of actions as good or evil, right or wrong, then tort or criminal law is a subset of ethics identifying certain actions as appropriate for using violence against them. The law says that action $X$ should be illegal, and therefore *should* be combated by the violence of the law. The law is a set of “ought” or normative propositions.<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>

# Law as a Subset of Ethics

To proceed with an explication of Austrian legal theory, we must understand what the nature of law is. First, law is a normative standard, that is to say that law is evaluative&#x2014;legal theory identifies a group of criminals and a group of non-criminals with reference to a norm. However, there are normative questions that law does not cover&#x2013;such as the question of whether to wear red or blue&#x2013;that is to say, there may be certain norms, certain guides to action, which are not covered by law, so law cannot be *exhaustive* of evaluative philosophy.

Second, we know that law deals with *justice*, that is to say, law prohibits that which is unjust, and permits that which is just. What is meant by saying that $X$ is just, is that $X$ can be argumentatively justified. So law is a normative standard which guides men to just over unjust actions.

Third, argumentative justification is a human action, requiring the use of scarce means&#x2014;lets unpack that. Action is defined as purposeful behaviour, it is the implementation of some scarce means towards some end&#x2014;consider the example of John eating a ham sandwich to satiate his hunger. His end is the removal of the hunger, and his means to achieve this end is the ham sandwich. Of note here is that the means a man employs is necessarily scarce, which means that his use of it prevents others from being able to use it. Therefore in argumentatively justifying anything a man has to concern himself with scarcity.

Fourth, because of scarcity there is a possibility for conflicts. Conflicts are defined as contradictory actions, so if Crusoe and Friday are on an island and Crusoe is trying to use a stick to spearfish at the same time that Friday is trying to use it to stoke his fire we have a conflict. The stick is scarce, so its use by one man prevents the other man from using it, so only one action&#x2013;spear fishing or stoking of the fire&#x2013;is able to take place, that is to say that one action excludes the other.

Fifth, because the possibility for conflict exists and cannot be ignored in argumentative justification, any legal theory must assign exclusive property rights so as to determine the just winner in a given conflict. That is to say, law identifies which set of people have just possession (non-criminals) and which set have unjust possession (criminals). In other words, law couldn’t assign that a given possession is both just and unjust.

Sixth, a position on the just winner in a conflict, which is to say a position on law, is a position on ethics. Ethics is the area of philosophy which deals in general with guides to mans action&#x2014;i.e. what man ought do. Specifically, law is a subset of ethics which deals with who should have possession of what, we can therefore define law as ethics applied to the issue of conflicts. Consider what it would mean to say that law is not in fact a subset of ethics &#x2014; $A$ claims that he cannot justify his possession of $\alpha$, but also that he should nevertheless possess it. What is meant by $A$ claiming that he should possess $\alpha$? This claim by $A$ is an attempt to justify $A$’s possession, which claims that he cannot do, therefore $A$ is in contradiction, we shall see shortly that contradictions are falsehoods, therefore meaning that it cannot be the case that $A$ should have possession where said possession is unjust. So, law must be a subset of ethics&#x2014;there does not exist any legal claim which is not also a moral claim.


# Objective Law and its Critics


## The Failure of Legal Polylogism

As we have seen, law is strictly derivable from the nature of argumentation as a human action, employing scarce physical means, therefore to assert that there are multiple different legal codes is to assert that there are multiple different logics, which is called polylogism. Legal-polylogism, then, is the claim that different men may be able to adopt different logics in their argumentative justification of a system of property rights.

The general problem with legal-polylogism is that it implies contradiction, because for there to be different legal codes, $A,\cdots,Z$, $A$ must be incompatible with every other legal code, $B,\cdots,Z$, in at least one aspect, or else they would not be different, but the same, and we would be back to singular law. Imagine that $A$ and $B$ are incompatible on an action $\alpha$, $A$ claims it to be just and $B$ claims it to be unjust. The legal-polylogist asserts that both $A$ *and* $B$ are correct, that $\alpha$ can both be justified and it cannot be justified—a contradiction. The problem with that is that contradictions are false, which we can see from the nature of argumentation. Imagine Sally and Eric are in an argument over the truth of the proposition $p$. Eric claims that $p$ is the case, and Sally claims $p$ that is not the case&#x2014;meaning that Eric asserts $p$ and Sally asserts $\neg p$. For Sallys case to be considered an attempted refutation of Eric, rather than simply speaking gibberish or telling a joke, she must pre-suppose that $p$ and $\neg p$ cannot both be correct&#x2014;that is to say, in disputing anything, you pre-suppose the law of non-contradiction, $\neg(p\wedge\neg p)$.


## The Failure of Legal Positivism

The Stanford Encyclopædia of Philosophy defines legal positivism as the thesis that the existence and content of law depends on social facts and not its merits.<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup> In other words, a legal positivist claims that law is not a subset of ethics, and thus there could potentially be such a thing as a virtuous crime to a legal positivist. The article elaborates:

> The positivist thesis does not say that law’s merits are unintelligible, unimportant, or peripheral to the philosophy of law. It says that they do not determine whether laws or legal systems *exist*. Whether a society has a legal system depends on the presence of certain structures of governance, not on the extent to which it satisfies ideals of justice, democracy, or the rule of law. What laws are in force in that system depends on what social standards its officials recognize as authoritative; for example, legislative enactments, judicial decisions, or social customs. The fact that a policy would be just, wise, efficient, or prudent is never sufficient reason for thinking that it is actually the law, and the fact that it is unjust, unwise, inefficient or imprudent is never sufficient reason for doubting it. According to positivism, law is a matter of what has been posited (ordered, decided, practiced, tolerated, etc.).

Law to the legal positivist, then, is a description of the specific arrangement of possessions that actually obtain, rather than a theory describing the just arrangement of possessions. Let’s break that down, the legal positivist is making the claim that law has nothing to do with justice, rather, the law is determined by raw might, that is if $A$ is able to physically defeat $B$ in a conflict and thus perform an action $\alpha$, the positivist goes only as far to point and say, “look, $A$ won the conflict, therefore the law on this conflict is that $A$ won.” But, this is a complete non-theory; ok, $A$ won, so what? How on Earth they think they get to cordon off an area of philosophy and take the label “law” for what can be summed up in the sentence, “whoever wins a given conflict has won that conflict,” is beyond me. The legal positivist as such can’t even elucidate a theory predicting when people will choose to engage in conflict and who is likely to win&#x2014;those would be the domains of economics and military theory respectively.

The problems with the positivist thesis do not stop here, even if a positivist were to reject the separation of law and justice, claiming that might makes right, their theory is still in ruin. Because the might makes right theory of law is a form of legal polylogism&#x2014;it is the claim that the logic of which actions are justifiable can change depending on whether you are able to successfully carry out that action and muscle away anybody who gets in the way. As we saw above, legal polylogism in general is false, therefore this form of legal positivism is false also.


## Objective Law as a Science of Human Action

So we have seen that the nature of law implies that there must be universal law&#x2014;that is, any form of legal polylogism is necessarily false, and further to argue or dispute anything would pre-suppose the existence of a single, universal law. We can say that this universal law is therefore *true* law, as it is the normative foundation of argumentation, and argumentation is a practical pre-condition for ascertaining the truth or validity of anything. Imagine attempting to dispute that this law is true, first you would have to accept its validity as that validity is implied by the act of argumentation, so you would therefore be explicitly proclaiming it to be false whilst implicitly pre-supposing it to be true, which is a contradiction. A contradiction, not between propositions, but between a proposition and the very act of proposing it. But there is no such thing as a free-floating proposition which does not come from an actor proposing it, therefore there is an objective, natural law.

It is this natural law which shall be elucidated in this course, we understand that its nature is that it is specifically a study of human action, the general science of human action is called praxeology, so law is a sub-science of praxeology. In the next lesson you will learn about the foundational axiom, called the non-aggression principle.
