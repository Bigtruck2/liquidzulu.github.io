title: "An Elaboration on the Nature of Law as a Subset of Ethics"
description: "A worrying tendency exists among libertarians, where it is often said that law is not a subset of ethics. In other words, these libertarians claim that there is such a thing as a crime that ought be committed. Insofar as this tendency is perpetuated, law is relegated to being a pointless field with no reason for existing. Hence I demonstrate that law properly understood is to be placed as a subset of ethics, dealing with the question of which party in a conflict ought have possession."

# Against the Separation of Ethics and Law

In the preparation for and the writing of this course I have encountered a strange tendency wherein the claim that &ldquo;people ought not violate the rights of others&rdquo; is apparently a controversial one even among Austrians. This is indicative of a severe problem in Austro-Libertarian circles that deserves a dedicated section of the course to properly address. The root of the problem is that many reject the core defnition of law as a subset of ethics, claiming instead that there is such a thing as a virtuous crime. The paragon example would be a man who is about to commit suicide by jumping off of a cliff, and the only way to save this man is to violate his rights by grabbing him and dragging him away from the cliffs edge.

I believe much of the confusion on this topic stems from the fact that many libertarians (at least appear to be) somewhat inconsistent, at some points indicating that law is indeed a subset of ethics and at other points rejecting this position. Rothbard explicitly states in his work on pollution that &ldquo;law is a subset of ethics,&rdquo;<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup> and &ldquo;a set of &lsquo;ought&rsquo; or normative propositions,&rdquo; but his discussion of &ldquo;lifeboat scenarios&rdquo; in *The Ethics of Liberty* is commonly cited to negate this point. Rothbard presents the conundrum as follows:<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup>

> It is often contended that the existence of extreme, or &ldquo;lifeboat,&rdquo; situations disproves any theory of absolute property rights, or indeed of any absolute rights of self-ownership whatsoever. It is claimed that since any theory of individual rights seems to break down or works unsatisfactorily in such fortunately rare situations, therefore there can be no concept of inviolable rights at all. In a typical lifeboat situation, there are, let us say, eight places in a lifeboat putting out from a sinking ship, and there are more than eight people wishing to be saved. Who then is to decide who should be saved and who should die?

On its face, this appears to not present any serious problem to the theory presented in this course&#x2014;the fact that the truth of the matter is unsatisfactory or makes someone upset or look like a bad guy for presenting it does not constitute a refutation of said truth. Indeed, to warp ones ethics to suit ones intuitions such that any &ldquo;unsatisfactory&rdquo; results are purged would be to surrender oneself to accepting the mystic power of whim to grant truth, thus tainting an otherwise sound epistemology.<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3" role="doc-backlink">3</a></sup> Thus I shall proceed with the analysis without caring about how nasty-sounding the conclusion reached may be. In the first place we have a scarcity, only 8 spots in the lifeboat and more than 8 people, thus property rights must be assigned. Presumably this lifeboat did not materialise in nature and was instead built by or purchased by whomever owns the boat, thus it is he who has the right to say who gets a spot. Perhaps he makes a rule that women and children go first, perhaps he decides that crewmates get priority over customers, and so on. Whatever arbitrary rules he sets ought be abided.

Now what of the situation where the owner set no rules forth and has died abandoning the lifeboat into the domain of nature? We surely already have our solution in the homesteading principle&#x2014;first come first served. If you get to a spot in the lifeboat you are thus using said spot and thus get to dictate how it is to be used (presumably you would want it to be used to save yourself). This might be horribly unfair to those who are slower or started further away from the lifeboat, but tough luck! Life isn&rsquo;t fair and neither is law&#x2014;the prime goal of law is justice not fairness. What, after all, would be the alternative? That people who are slower to get to the boat (i.e. latecomers) are the ones who should get a spot? Well then the people they kick out could just immediately return to the boat as an even later-comer, thus entering us into an endless dance of groups getting in and out of the boat&#x2014;everyone would be equal but everyone would be dead. It seems that Rothbard came to the same conclusion:

> If the owner of the boat or his representative (e. g. the captain of the ship) has died in the wreck, and if he has not laid down known rules in advance of the wreck for allocation of seats in such a crisis, then the lifeboat may be considered&#x2013;at least temporarily for the emergency&#x2013;abandoned and therefore unowned. At this point, our rules for unowned property come into play: namely, that unowned resources become the property of the first people possessing them. In short, the first eight people to reach the boat are, in our theory, the proper &ldquo;owners&rdquo; and users of the boat. Anyone who throws them out of the boat then commits an act of aggression in violating the property right of the &ldquo;homesteader&rdquo; he throws out of the boat. After he returns to shore, then, the aggressor becomes liable for prosecution for his act of violation of property right (as well, perhaps, for murder of the person he ejected from the boat).

Rothbard continues with the following:

> In the first place, a lifeboat situation is hardly a valid test of a theory of rights, or of any moral theory whatsoever. Problems of a moral theory in such an extreme situation do not invalidate a theory for normal situations. In any sphere of moral theory, we are trying to frame an ethic for man, based on his nature and the nature of the world-and this precisely means for normal nature, for the way life usually is, and not for rare and abnormal situations. It is a wise maxim of the law, for precisely this reason, that &ldquo;hard cases make bad law.&rdquo; We are trying to frame an ethic for the way men generally live in the world; we are not, after all,
> interested in framing an ethic that focuses on situations that are
> rare, extreme, and not generally encountered.
> 
> Let us take an example, to illustrate our point, outside the sphere of property rights or rights in general, and within the sphere of ordinary ethical values. Most people would concede the principle that &ldquo;it is ethical for a parent to save his child from drowning.&rdquo; But, then, our lifeboat skeptic could arise and hurl this challenge: &ldquo;Aha, but suppose that two of your children are drowning and you can save only one. Which child would you choose? And doesn&rsquo;t the fact that you would have to let one child die negate the very moral principle that you should save your drowning child?&rdquo; I doubt whether many ethicists would throw over the moral desirability or principle of saving one&rsquo;s child because it could not be fully applied in such a &ldquo;lifeboat&rdquo; situation. Yet why should the lifeboat case be different in the sphere of rights?

The response here indicates that there are at least two *different* spheres of ethics, one for normal situations and one for abnormal ones. It is not clear, however, how on Earth it could be possible to make a non-arbitrary distinction between &ldquo;normal&rdquo; and &ldquo;abnormal&rdquo; ethical conundrums. Moreover, if such a principled distinction cannot be made between normal and abnormal such a theory would be particularistic and thus irrational. That is to say, there are certainly many differences one could use to define normal as opposed to abnormal; say that situations where red shirts are worn are abnormal and where red shirts are not worn the situation is normal. That would be a difference, but the difference is not relevant to ethical theory&#x2014;thus a rational norm must apply to both classes of situations in order to be universal as opposed to particular. Until such a principled difference can be found to define normal as opposed to abnormal we are stuck with universal norms having to apply to both classes and thus there are not two &ldquo;spheres&rdquo; of moral theory. That is to say; it couldn&rsquo;t be the case that property rights hold &ldquo;normally&rdquo; but not &ldquo;abnormally,&rdquo; as such would be a particularistic property norm, and thus an irrational one.

I must now consider Rothbards drowning children hypothetical, in the case of the single child it is assumed that the parent can save them, and in the case of two children it is assumed that only one can be saved. There are indeed certain similarities between the drowning children and the lifeboat&#x2014;for the case of two children one will die and one will live, for the lifeboat 8 will live and others will die. The question is how to determine who should live and who should die. We have our solution in the case of the lifeboat, and it strikes me that this course provides a similar ability to answer the drowning children example. The mother cannot physically save both, thus it is surely a matter of personal preference which one she saves, and why should she be expected to act any differently? It would be logically impossible for her to pick the one she would prefer not to save, and thus the only alternative would be to let both drown. Surely we can easily sum this up in a universal principle&#x2014;guardians ought save their children from drowning insofar as they have the ability to. It is not my claim that this principle has been proven, after all this is a law course not a course on ethics in general, but I cannot see how this would not be universal and it certainly seems that it easily deals with Rothbards hypothetical opponent.

Rothbard seemingly goes forth with his multi-sphere model (emphasis added):

> It may well be objected to our theory as follows: that a theory of property rights or even of self-ownership is derivable from the conditions by which man survives and flourishes in this world, and that therefore in this kind of extreme situation, where a man is faced with the choice of either saving himself or violating the property rights of the lifeboat owner (or, in the above example, of the &ldquo;homesteader&rdquo; in the boat), it is then ridiculous to expect him to surrender his life on behalf of the abstract principle of property rights. Because of this kind of consideration, many libertarians who otherwise believe in property rights gravely weaken them on behalf of the &ldquo;contextualist&rdquo; contention that, given a choice between his life and aggressing against someone else&rsquo;s property or even life, it is moral for him to commit the aggression and that therefore in such a situation, these property rights cease to exist. **The error here on the part of the &ldquo;contextualist&rdquo; libertarians is to confuse the question of the moral course of action for the person in such a tragic situation with the totally separate question of whether or not his seizing of lifeboat or plank space by force constitutes an invasion of someone else&rsquo;s property right.** For we are not, in constructing a theory of liberty and property, i.e., a &ldquo;political&rdquo; ethic, concerned with all personal moral principles. We are not herewith concerned whether it is moral or immoral for someone to lie, to be a good person, to develop his faculties, or be kind or mean to his neighbors. We are concerned, in this sort of discussion, solely with such &ldquo;political ethical&rdquo; questions as the proper role of violence, the sphere of rights, or the definitions of criminality and aggression. Whether or not it is moral or immoral for &ldquo;Smith&rdquo;&#x2013;the fellow excluded by the owner from the plank or the lifeboat&#x2013;to force someone else out of the lifeboat, or whether he should die heroically instead, is not our concern, and not the proper concern of a theory of political ethics.

On a first glance, it would seem that Rothbard is adopting a dichotomy between law and ethics, and this very passage has been cited to me numerous times to that effect. But to my eye that is only one of multiple valid interpretations of Rothbards writing here&#x2014;it appears to me that he is merely hedging his bets in ignoring the questions of ethics as a whole and focusing in on the area that he has expertise in. This highlights why Rothbard saw fit to analogise the lifeboat scenario to &ldquo;ordinary ethical values;&rdquo; if law was not a subset of ethics, i.e. if it did not deal with &ldquo;ought&rdquo; statements such an analogy would be incoherent. Furthermore, Rothbard is correct that &ldquo;we are not, in constructing a theory of liberty and property [&#x2026;] concerned with **all** personal moral principles,&rdquo; we are rather only concerned with those moral principles that pertain to conflicts over scarce means. This does not, as the critics claim, demonstrate that law and ethics are disconnected fields. Clearly, if we are concerned with a subset of all moral principles which deals specifically with conflicts in doing law then law itself is a subset of morality in general. This analysis is also consistent with Rothbards claim that &ldquo;[w]hether or not it is moral or immoral for &lsquo;Smith&rsquo;&#x2013;the fellow excluded by the owner from the plank or the lifeboat&#x2013;to force someone else out of the lifeboat, or whether he should die heroically instead, is not our concern, and not the proper concern of a theory of political ethics.&rdquo; It very much appears to me that Rothbard is merely leaving the floor open for his legal theory to be compatible with any outside ethical theory that one may come up with&#x2014;even one that would allow for contradictions between &ldquo;personal&rdquo; and &ldquo;political&rdquo; ethics. Of course, such a theory would be false, but that is not the concern of Rothbard qua legal theorist. This becomes clear in a footnote attached to the end of the above paragraph, commenting on an example where two men are floating in the water and there is a plank that can save only one of them:

> Eric Mack&rsquo;s example fails to show a necessary conflict between property rights and moral principles. The conflict in his example is between property rights and the dictates of prudence or self-interest. But the latter is only dominant in morality if one adopts moral egoism, which indeed Professor Mack does, but which is only one possible moral theory.

This makes it abundantly clear to me that Rothbard is, as I claim, simply trying to make his ethic as narrow as possible such that it may be slotted into any general ethical theory. Rothbard continues:

> The crucial point is that *even* if the contextualist libertarian may say that, given the tragic context, Smith *should* throw someone else out of the lifeboat to save his own life, he is *still* committing, at the very least, invasion of property rights, and probably also murder of the person thrown out. So that even if one says that he should try to save his life by forcibly grabbing a seat in the lifeboat, he is still, in our view, liable to prosecution as a criminal invader of property right, and perhaps as a murderer as well. After he is convicted, it would be the *right* of the lifeboat owner or the heir of the person tossed out to forgive Smith, to pardon him because of the unusual circumstances; but it would also be their right *not* to pardon and to proceed with the full force of their legal right to punish. Once again, we are concerned in this theory with the rights of the case, *not* with whether or not a person chooses voluntarily to exercise his rights. In our view, the property owner or the heir of the killed would have a right to prosecute and to exact proper punishment upon the aggressor. The fallacy of the contextualists is to confuse considerations of individual, personal morality (what should Smith do?) with the question of the rights of the case. The right of property continues, then, to be absolute, even in the tragic lifeboat situation.

Again, Rothbards use of the *even if* disclaimer prior to the hypothetical proof that Smith should throw someone out of the lifeboat is a crystal-clear signal that Rothbard is merely entertaining this *as* a hypothetical counter to his thesis. What Rothbard has done is that he has shown his theory of property rights to hold *even if* someone were to prove that there are separate &ldquo;personal&rdquo; and &ldquo;political&rdquo; spheres of ethics. To re-iterate; Rothbard has not here *accepted* that there is indeed such a proof, all he has done is shown that the existence of such a proof is *irrelevant* to his legal theory.

Of course, such a proof does not exist, as said multi-sphere ethics would be a polylogism. Ought is ought, there is not ought-but-personal and a separate ought-but-political. There is only ought. Confusion on this matter comes due to colloquial usage of the word &ldquo;ought&rdquo; in sentences like, &ldquo;you ought wear a coat because you don&rsquo;t want to get wet.&rdquo; There are two ways we can interpret this statement, either we assume that &ldquo;ought&rdquo; is being used in the precise logical meaning, or we assume it is being used as prudential advice. In the former case, the statement is simply invalid, it does not follow from the fact that a person doesn&rsquo;t want to get wet that they ought prevent themselves from getting wet by wearing a coat. After all, I may want to rape a baby but it does not follow from the existence of this whim that I actually ought obey it. The latter interpretation of &ldquo;ought&rdquo; being prudential advice is a colloquial usage of the word&#x2014;what is really being said is &ldquo;if you want to not get wet wearing a coat will achieve this goal,&rdquo; which is clearly an &ldquo;is&rdquo; statement, all that is being said is that the given strategy will attain the goal, not whether the goal is proper. Thus it could not be that &ldquo;politically&rdquo; you ought not aggress but &ldquo;personally&rdquo; you ought aggress, as that would be a contradiction&#x2014;you ought aggress and you ought not aggress. Then it appears clear that Rothbard holds law as a subset of ethics but has also successfully shielded his theory from any attack which would seek to separate them.

This stance becomes confusing in the light of modern Austrian theorists, Hoppe has shown with his argumentation ethics that any attempt at negating the NAP leads to contradiction, but elsewhere claims that he was not attempting to derive an &ldquo;ought&rdquo; from an &ldquo;is.&rdquo;<sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4" role="doc-backlink">4</a></sup> But surely if an ought statement which negates the NAP falls into contradiction its negation must be true? This will be analysed in greater depth below, but for now the non-subset counter-thesis to my position is summed up explicitly by Konrad Graf:<sup><a id="fnr.5" class="footref" href="#fn.5" role="doc-backlink">5</a></sup>

> Placing deductive legal theory within praxeology enables its reconstruction as a categorical and definitional assessment of what types of actions are NAP infringements&#x2014;separate from moral assessment of such infringements. In this view, an example of an ethical statement would be, &ldquo;One should not violate rights.&rdquo; Legal theory helps to make this goal actionable by supplying information concerning the question: &ldquo;What is &lsquo;violating rights?&rsquo;&rdquo;

And what then does it mean to violate a right? As I&rsquo;m sure Konrad would agree<sup><a id="fnr.6" class="footref" href="#fn.6" role="doc-backlink">6</a></sup> it means that you could not justify your conduct, but what does it mean that you cannot justify your conduct? It means you cannot claim that your conduct **should** go forth as said claim implies a contradiction, thus its negation that your conduct **should not** go forth is true. This is a legal claim **and** an ethical one&#x2014;in fact, *every* legal claim is also an ethical claim, as every legal claim is a claim about which party **should** have possession in the conflict at hand.

> There *is* an intuitive relationship between law and ethics. However, I argue that it is not one of a field to a sub-field, but rather an *advisory* relationship between two distinct fields. [&#x2026;] If one takes on the moral objective of not aggressing, one is more likely to be *successful* at this in action with a clear idea of what aggression is. &ldquo;Rights infringements&rdquo; become one category of wrongs next to other non-legal categories of wrongs that a given ethical system may specify. Yet the definition of *what constitutes* infringing rights is derived independently of ethics using the categorical, counterfactual method of praxeology. Although [Argumentation Ethics] establishes that no propositional argument against the NAP can succeed, it does not prevent human beings from infringing the NAP *anyway*.

Indeed, Konrad is correct that argumentation ethics does not prevent people from engaging in aggression, but it does demonstrate that any attempted justification of that aggression would fall into contradiction&#x2014;that is to say any claim that one *ought* aggress implies a contradiction and thus its negation that one *ought not* aggress is *true*. Furthermore, Konrad himself states that &ldquo;the NAP forms the outer boundary of justifiability for any norm or rule,&rdquo;<sup><a id="fnr.7" class="footref" href="#fn.7" role="doc-backlink">7</a></sup> this is because any norm in contradiction to the NAP is simply incoherent via the nature of justification as such.

A favourite quote of the ethics and law separators comes from Hoppe himself, who states:<sup><a id="fnr.8" class="footref" href="#fn.8" role="doc-backlink">8</a></sup>

> [T]he praxeological proof of libertarianism has the advantage of offering a completely value-free justification of private property. It remains entirely in the realm of is-statements and never tries to derive an &ldquo;ought&rdquo; from an &ldquo;is.&rdquo; The structure of the argument is this: (a) justification is propositional justification&#x2014;a priori true is-statement; (b) argumentation presupposes property in one&rsquo;s body and the homesteading principle&#x2014;a priori true is-statement; and (c) then, no deviation from this ethic can be argumentatively justified&#x2014;a priori true is-statement. The proof also offers a key to an understanding of the nature of the fact-value dichotomy: Ought-statements cannot be derived from is-statements. They belong to different logical realms. It is also clear, however, that one cannot even state that there are facts and values if no propositional exchanges exist, and that this practice of propositional exchanges in turn presupposes the acceptance of the private property ethic as valid. In other words, cognition and truth-seeking as such have a normative foundation, and the normative foundation on which cognition and truth rest is the recognition of private property rights

Hoppe is indeed correct that his above syllogism is not of the form &ldquo;*is statement*, *is statement*, therefore *ought statement*,&rdquo; but those in the Konrad-camp are incorrect to conclude from this that argumentation ethics fails to demonstrate the truth and falsehood of different ought statements. As Hoppe himself stated in that very passage recognition of the private property ethic (aka the NAP) as valid is a pre-condition for arguing over anything&#x2014;thus, to try and dispute the NAP you have to first accept that it is true giving it axiomatic status just as surely as the action axiom or the law of non-contradiction. Furthermore we can use the conclusion of Hoppes above syllogism to construct a new syllogism:

1.  I ought engage in aggression $X \longrightarrow p\wedge\neg p$ (a priori true is-statement);
2.  $\neg(p\wedge\neg p)$ (a priori true is-statement);
3.  $\therefore$ I ought *not* engage in aggression $X$ (a priori true ought-statement).

In other words, $\neg\text{NAP}\longrightarrow p\wedge\neg p\ \therefore \neg(\neg\text{NAP})=\text{NAP}$, but how could this be if facts and values &ldquo;belong to different logical realms?&rdquo;


# Dismantling Hume&rsquo;s Guillotine

The issue we come to with this view is a dogmatic application of Hume&rsquo;s Guillotine, also called the fact-value dichotomy&#x2014;the claim is that its impossible to derive an *ought* from an *is*. But clearly I have done just that; the negation of the NAP is an ought statement that implies a contradiction, contradictions are false, therefore the NAP is true&#x2014;it is a *true* ought statement. However you want to describe this, whether I have &ldquo;sidestepped&rdquo; or &ldquo;transcended&rdquo; or plowed straight through Hume&rsquo;s Guillotine the fact remains that there are *true* values and thus there is no *dichotomy* between facts and values.

This statement is incredibly controversial in the face of modern subjectivist philosophy, where insofar as ethics is even thought about it is dismissed out of hand as a mere description of what people want to do. But of course, saying that a person, $A$ wants to do $X$ over $\neg X$ is the claim that $A$ thinks he *should* pick $X$ over $\neg X$ when given the chance&#x2014;that is to say a preference for $X$ over $\neg X$ *is itself* an ethical claim, so choice itself has value implications. I imagine almost everyone takes the is-ought gap for granted, thus I will take some time to further elaborate on why the fact-value dichotomy does not exist. `First I shall quickly re-state argumentation ethics in a brief form-argumentation is the practical pre-condition for ascertaining the truth or validity of any proposition, insofar as men argue they must pre-suppose the validity of the NAP, thus the validity of the NAP cannot be disputed without falling into contradiction.`
