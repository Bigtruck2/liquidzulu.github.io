title: "The Non-Aggression Principle"
description: "The Non-Aggression Principle is an axiom of law that assigns the property right to the individual who did not initiate a given conflict. Furthermore, justification as such implies a pre-supposition of the validity of this principle, making any denial of it a performative or dialectic contradiction. That is to say, \"Cognition and truth-seeking as such have a value [normative] foundation. And the normative foundation on which cognition and truth rest is the recognition of private property rights.\""

# Definition

In the previous lesson we discovered some necessary facts about the nature of law; we know that there must be a universal and objective law, and we know that the normative structure of law must be based upon the normative structure of argumentation. In this lesson the central norm&#x2013;the core axiom of true law&#x2013;will be made explicit.

We call this central axiom the Non-Aggression Principle, or NAP, and it can be stated as follows: the non-aggressor ought have possession, and the aggressor ought not have possession. Let’s break that down, here aggression is defined as the initiation of conflict, so in any contest over some property $\alpha$, if $A$ is the aggressor and $B$ the non-aggressor, $B$ ought have possession and $A$ ought not.


# The Argument from Argument

The term &rsquo;axiom&rsquo; has a precise meaning to an Austrian, unlike in mathematics where axioms are merely inter-consistent but arbitrarily chosen rules,<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup> praxeological axioms are self-evident propositions. A proposition is self-evident if you must accept its validity in attempting to dispute its validity. We saw above how the law of non-contradiction is a self-evident proposition, in disputing anything at all you first must accept that the law of non-contradiction holds.

Similarly, in disputing the NAP you pre-suppose its truth as it is implied by the very nature of argumentation. First, recall that argumentation does not exist in a normative void, that is to say there are certain norms which are pre-supposed in the very act of arguing. Consider what it would mean for this not to be the case: if argumentation had no particular normative structure it would lose any meaning&#x2014;literally any action a man takes could be considered an argumentation: such as eating an apple, or swinging from tree, or shooting someone through the head. It is because of the fact that certain norms *define* a dialectic as such that there is such a thing called argumentation in the first place.

Second, the validity of any truth claim must be raised and decided upon in the course of an argumentation, so the normative structure of argumentation in particular has the special status of being the practical pre-condition for ascertaining the truth or validity of any statement. This is known as the a priori of argumentation, which is another self-evident proposition&#x2014;if you were to dispute it, you would first have to start arguing thus pre-supposing its truth.

Third, to try and argumentatively dispute one of the norms of argumentation would be to contradict oneself, this is called a dialectic or performative contradiction. That is, it is a contradiction not between propositions, but between a proposition and the very act of proposing it. For instance, if one were to argue that people ought never argue they would first pre-suppose that they should be arguing, thus they are in contradiction. Therefore, the negation of &ldquo;people ought never argue,&rdquo;&ldquo; which is &rdquo;people ought ever argue,&ldquo;&rdquo; or &ldquo;people ought sometimes argue,&rdquo; must be correct. Of note is that under argumentation ethics the &ldquo;sometimes&rdquo; is not an arbitrary &ldquo;when I feel like it,&rdquo; it’s something more like, &ldquo;people should argue to resolve disputes&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;people should engage in conflict to resolve disputes.&rdquo;

This is because, fourth, argumentation is a conflict-free interaction, interlocutors have some dispute over the truth of the matter and they are seeking to convince the other not through the force of violence (i.e. by aggressing against them), but rather through the force of their argument. Specifically, argumentation is a method of resolving disputes peacefully, not violently. Consider $A$ and $B$ have a dispute over who has the property right to $\alpha$, $A$ asserts that they are the owner, and vice versa. Arguing over this dispute would not involve the two parties violently attacking each other, it would involve the exchange of propositions with the intent of determining the truth of the matter. This means that the normative structure of argumentation implies non-aggression, thus the NAP is dialectically true.

The next lesson will uncover some of the first implications of this axiom such as how men come to own property in the first place, and facts about the nature of said property rights.
